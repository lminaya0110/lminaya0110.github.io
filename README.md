# Wizard Trivia Game
&nbsp;   



## About The Project
&nbsp;  
In this trivia game users are able to test their knowledge of the Harry Potter universe.

As the questions come up, users select their answer and click the **evaluate** button to check if they got it right. The **next** button does not wait for a right answer, so users can move along through questions as they wish.
